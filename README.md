🚑 Hospital Emergency Room Dashboard – My Latest Data Analytics Project 📊
I’m excited to share that I recently learned how to design an interactive dashboard focused on analyzing Hospital Emergency Room data.
This project helped me understand how data analytics can improve healthcare decision-making and patient management.

🔎 Key Insights from the Dashboard:
✅ Patient Admission Status
Analyzed how many patients were admitted vs. not admitted, helping understand hospital capacity and emergency handling efficiency.
✅ Patient Age Distribution
Grouped patients by age categories to identify which age group visits the emergency room most frequently.
✅ Timeliness (Service Within 30 Minutes)
Measured the percentage of patients attended within 30 minutes.
This helps evaluate hospital response time and operational performance.
✅ Gender Analysis
Visualized the number of patients by gender to observe demographic trends in emergency visits.
✅ Department Referrals
Identified which departments (General Practice, Orthopedics, Cardiology, etc.) receive the most referrals from the emergency room.
This provides insight into resource allocation and departmental workload.

📌 What I Learned:
• Data cleaning and transformation
• Creating KPIs (Key Performance Indicators)
• Designing interactive filters (Year & Month selection)
• Building meaningful visualizations
• Turning raw data into actionable insights

This project strengthened my skills in data analysis and dashboard design, and it gave me practical exposure to healthcare analytics.
I’m continuously learning and improving my Data Analytics & BI skills.
Open to feedback and suggestions! 😊
